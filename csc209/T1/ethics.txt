I think that accessing your classmates' files without them knowing is ethically wrong, even if you do not do anything with it. I think that regardless of what the files are and what information they contain, if you are going through them and looking around, knowing that you should not be, it is still wrong and an invasion of privacy. Simply looking at something not meant for your eyes is wrong. Accessing such information can lead to unintended consequences. You might not misuse the information immediately, but it opens the possibility for future use or accidentally sharing the information to others. The severity of harm depends on the nature of the information accessed and what is done with it.

For instance, if the information is less personal, like class notes or a to-do list, accessing those files could be considered a harmless wrong. This is because, while it's a privacy invasion, it's unlikely to cause significant harm to the classmate. However, if the information is more sensitive and personal, like a diary, grades, or passwords, the ethical breach becomes more severe. Even without any misuse of the information, the act of accessing such personal details is a major privacy violation. The potential for harm increases significantly; psychological harm could result from exposure of personal thoughts, or physical risks could emerge if personal addresses are discovered. The exposure of passwords increases the risk of data breaches and hacking, leading to lots of potentially extreme outcomes.

In conclusion, accessing private information, regardless of its use or the owner's awareness, is ethically wrong. It's a violation of privacy that can lead to various risks and harms.
