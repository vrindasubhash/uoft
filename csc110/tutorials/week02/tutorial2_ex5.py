    """Return the number of character positions where s1 and s2 differ.

    Compare s1 and s2 character by character (s1[0] vs. s2[0], s1[1] vs. s2[1], etc.)

    You may ASSUME that:
        - s1 and s2 have the same length
        - s1 and s2 are both non-empty
        - s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase letters (a-z)

    >>> num_differing_characters('the', 'tre')
    1
    >>> num_differing_characters('banana', 'amazon')
    6

    HINT: use range(0, len(s1)) in a filtering comprehension to compute a set of
    indexes where s1 and s2 differ, and then compute the size of that set.

    Uses the set of words WORDS imported from tutorial2_words.py.
    Note: s may or may not be a valid English word.

    You can sort a list of lowercase strings alphabetically by using the built-in function `sorted`.

    You may ASSUME that:
        - s is non-empty
        - s contains only lowercase letters (a-z)

    different valid English words.

def autocorrect_word(s: str) -> str:

    Return s itself if it is a valid English word (i.e., is in tutorial2_words.WORDS) or
    has no suggestions, and its first (in alphabetical order) suggestion if it is invalid
    but has at least one suggestion.

def autocorrect_words(strings: list) -> list:
    """Return a list containing autocorrected versions of each string in strings.

    Hint: Use a list comprehension on strings, calling autocorrect_word on each one.

    You may ASSUME that:
        - Every element of strings is a valid argument to autocorrect_word.

def autocorrect_text(text: str) -> str:
    """Return an autocorrected version of text.

    Here, text is a string containing lowercase letter words separated by spaces.
    The returned string should have an autocorrected version of each word in the
    given text.

    You may ASSUME that:
        - text consists of words separated by a single space
        - each word in the given text consists of only lowercase letters

    >>> autocorrect_text('you tre zool')
    'you are cool'

    HINTS:
        - You've already seen str.split on Prep 2, which can convert from a string
          to a list of words.
        - The opposite is str.join, which takes a separator string and a list of
          strings, and joins the strings together into one string, using the
          given separator string in between.

          >>> str.join(' ', ['David', 'is', 'cool'])
          'David is cool'
