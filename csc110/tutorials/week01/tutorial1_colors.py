"""CSC110 Tutorial 1: Data and Functions (Colour Visualization)

Module Description
==================
This Python file contains some code for visualizing colours using Pygame.

You do *not* need to understand how any of this code works for Tutorial 1.
But don't worry, over the next few weeks you'll learn about how to use Pygame
to create your own visualizations.
