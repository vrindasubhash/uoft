# Exercise 2: Practice Writing Functions
###############################################################################
# In this part, you'll write some functions to help review the data types
# you learned about in lecture this week, and to get some practice
# writing functions. We recommend working individually but asking a classmate
# or your TA if you get stuck. After each function, you should check your work
# by running this file (right-click -> "Run File in Python Console"), and
# typing in the doctest example to see whether the returned value matches
# what the doctest example says.

# Exercise 4: Representing colour data
###############################################################################
# In this task, you'll work with lists representing colour data in the RGB24
# colour model. Each of the functions you'll define in this section returns a
# list of colours. To visualize your work, run this file and call the function,
# and save the returned list in a variable.
# Then run the following in the Python console:
#   >>> tutorial1_colours.show_colours(<YOUR VARIABLE HERE>)
#
# This should open a Pygame window showing your colours. :)
