"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Assignment 1, Part 2: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains the functions you should complete for Part 2 of this assignment.
Your task is to complete this module by doing the following for EACH function below:

1. Add a new doctest example to the function description in the space provided.
   This will ensure you understand what the function is supposed to do.
   (If you want, you may add more than one doctest for your own testing purposes.)
2. Implement the body of the function so that it does what its description claims.

In some function descriptions, we have written "You may ASSUME..." This means that
when you are writing each function body, you only have to consider possible values
for the parameters that satisfy these assumptions. You do not need to check for,
or "handle", values that violate these assumptions.

We have marked each place you need to write a doctest/code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each "TODO" comment---this is a
good habit to get into early!

By the way, we *will* be checking that you've added new doctest examples, and that
your examples correctly illustrate a call to that function. Don't skip this!

For instructions on checking your work with python_ta, please consult the
assignment handout.

        - The second list element is True if s[1] is a lowercase vowel, and False otherwise

    A lowercase vowel is one of the five letters {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}.
