"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Assignment 2, Part 1: Conditional Execution

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains the function mystery_3 described on the assignment handout,
and the start of various test cases to either complete or delete, according to the
instructions found below.

We have provided code in the main block of this file to run your test cases using pytest.

NOTE: We will *NOT* be checking this file with PythonTA.

# INSTRUCTIONS: below, there are four (incomplete) property-based test functions,
# one for each branch of mystery_3. For each of the tests, you should either:
# 1. Complete it by replacing the ... with an assert statement which says that
#    mystery_3 never returns the value in that branch's return statement, OR
# 2. Delete or comment out the test, if that branch is reachable.
#
# NOTE: These tests use a new hypothesis strategy function, text, which (as
# you might have guessed) is a strategy for generating "random" string values.
