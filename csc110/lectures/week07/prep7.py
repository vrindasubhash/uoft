"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Prep 7: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains several function headers and descriptions.
We have marked each place you need to fill in with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You do not need to include doctests for this prep, though we strongly encourage you
to check your work carefully!

Note: the last two function's preconditions refer to math.gcd, which isn't actually
imported. This means that python_ta.contracts won't actually check those preconditions,
so it will be up to you to verify that these preconditions hold when you call the
functions in your own testing.

# Implementing a new symmetric-key cryptosystem
###############################################################################
# In this exercise, you'll implement the encryption and decryption functions for a new
# symmetric-key cryptosystem described as follows:
#
# - The plaintexts and ciphertexts are strings.
# - The secret key is from the *infinite* set {2, 3, ...}.
# - Encrypt(k, m) works as follows:
#     PRECONDITION: math.gcd(k, len(m)) == 1.
#         (It's possible to make the encryption work without this assumption,
#          but harder to do, so for this prep you can assume this holds.)
#
#     The ciphertext c has the same length as m.
#     For all i in {0, 1, ..., len(m) - 1), c[(i * k) % len(m)] == m[i].
#     In other words, c is a permutation (reordering) of the characters of m.
#
# - Decrypt(k, c) works as follows:
#     PRECONDITION: math.gcd(k, len(c)) = 1.
#
#     Simply do the encryption in reverse:
#     For all i in {0, 1, ..., len(c) - 1), m[i] = c[(i * k) % len(m)].
#
#  Example: m = 'David is cool', and k = 2. len(m) = 13 (Follow along on paper!)
#    m[0] -> c[0]
#    m[1] -> c[2]
#    m[2] -> c[4]
#    m[3] -> c[6]
#    m[4] -> c[8]
#    m[5] -> c[10]
#    m[6] -> c[12]
#    m[7] -> c[1]   <-- Since we're taking remainders modulo 13, and (2 * 7) % 13 == 1.
#    m[8] -> c[3]
#    m[9] -> c[5]
#    m[10] -> c[7]
#    m[11] -> c[9]
#    m[12] -> c[11]
#
#    So the encrypted string is 'Dsa vciodo li'

        - math.gcd(k, len(plaintext)) == 1

    >>> encrypt_symmetric_modulo(2, 'David is cool')

    Hint: this is tricky, and easiest done using an index-based for loop and list mutation.
    We've set up an accumulator for you to use: a list of characters of length m that you
    should fill in. Inside your loop use list index assignment to set a particular index
    in the accumulator, and then at the end of the function join the characters into a
    single string using str.join('', the_accumulator_list).
