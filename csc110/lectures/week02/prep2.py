"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Prep 2: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains several function headers and descriptions.
Your task is to complete this module by doing the following for EACH function below:

1. Add a new doctest example to the function description in the space provided.
   This will ensure you understand what the function is supposed to do.
2. Write the body of the function so that it does what its description claims.

In some function descriptions, we have written "You may ASSUME..." This means that
when you are writing each function body, you only have to consider possible values
for the parameters that satisfy these assumptions.

We have marked each place you need to write a doctest/code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each "TODO" comment---this is a
good habit to get into early! To check your work, you should run this file in
the Python console and then call each function manually (you can also copy-and-paste)
with your doctest examples, and possibly other examples.

(We'll cover more techniques for testing your code this week.)

By the way, we *will* be checking that you've added new doctest examples, and that
your examples correctly illustrate a call to that function. Don't skip this!

NOTE: we are not using PythonTA to check your work for this prep. We'll be introducing
PythonTA in class this week.
