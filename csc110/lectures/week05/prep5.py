"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Prep 5: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains several function headers and descriptions.
Your task is to complete this module by doing the following for EACH function below:

1. Implement the function so that it does what its description claims,
   using a for loop. You may NOT use comprehensions for any part of this exercise.

    - You *may* use augmented assignment operations like "x += y" as a short form for
      "x = x + y". This will be covered in Chapter 6 of the Course Notes (and in lecture
      next week).

You do *not* need to add new doctests or preconditions (and in fact
you should *not* add any preconditions!). However, you may add doctests
to test your code---we certainly encourage you to test your code carefully
before making your final submission!

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment---this is a
good habit to get into early!
