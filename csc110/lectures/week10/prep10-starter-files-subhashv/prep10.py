"""CSC110 Fall 2022 Prep 10: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains a new *class definition* with attributes and representation
invariants already defined. We have started a few different methods in the class body,
and your task is to implement EACH method based on the method header and description.

There are two helper functions we have provided near the bottom of this file; please do
not modify either of them.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You do not need to add additional doctests. However, you should test your work carefully
before submitting it!

Copyright and Usage Information

class Spinner:
    """A spinner for a board game.

    A spinner has a certain number of slots, numbered starting at 0 and
    increasing by 1 each slot. For example, if the spinner has 6 slots,
    they are numbered 0 through 5, inclusive.

    A spinner also has an arrow that points to one of these slots.

    Instance Attributes:
      - slots: The number of slots in this spinner.
      - position: The slot number that the spinner's arrow is currently pointing to.

    Representation Invariants:
      - 0 <= self.position < self.slots

    Sample Usage:

    >>> s = Spinner(8)  # Create a spinner with 8 slots
    >>> s.position      # A spinner initially points to slot 0
    0
    >>> s.spin(4)
    >>> s.position

    def draw(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
        """Draw this spinner onto the given pygame screen.

        (See starter file images for some examples.)

        The drawing of the spinner consists of two parts:

        1. The outline of a circle that fills the given screen (we have provided this part
           for you already).
        2. The circle is filled by equal sectors, one for each slot. The first sector
           (corresponding to slot 0) should start on the radius of the circle extending
           horizontally to the right of the circle's centre, and extend counter-clockwise.
           The remaining sectors are numbered in counter-clockwise order starting from
           this first sector.

           For example, if self.slots == 6, each sector spans 60 degrees (pi / 3 radians),
           starting at the "positive x direction" relative to the circle's centre.

           Each slot has a colour chosen by the provided get_colour function (don't change
           this function!). See below for some implementation notes.

        Note: This method will display an empty circle if the number of slots in the spinner
        is too high for a small screen size. This is normal, and you don't need to fix this.

            # the COLOR should be the value obtained from calling our provided
            # helper function Spinner.get_colour;
            # the WIDTH argument should be the radius of the circle;
            # and the START_ANGLE and STOP_ANGLE should be calculated by doing a
            # bit of math. Note that the angles are all calculated in radians,
            # so you should use the constant math.pi in your calculation.
            # Hint: slot 0's sector starts with start_angle == 0.
            #
            # One limitation of pygame is that is doesn't do filled-in arcs very well.
            # To compensate for this, try adding a small value to the stop angles
            # of each sector to fill in the gaps that you'll see if you just use the
            # angles you get from evenly dividing the circle.
