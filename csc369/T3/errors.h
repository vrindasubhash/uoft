//NOTE: If compiled in debug mode (default), you should report errors to stderr.
// If compiled in non-debug mode (NDEBUG preprocessor macro is defined), this
// output should be disabled. In this case, we instead rely only on errno to
// report the error. This is what is normally expected from a system library -
// reporting errors is the responsibility of the program using the library. You
// should use the macros defined below for any error output.

/**
 * Print debugging information when an error is detected.
 *
 * Assumes that the current value of errno describes the error being reported.
 * This macro is basically an enhanced version of perror() and should be used in
 * a similar fashion (see "man 3 perror"). The message is suffixed with the code
 * location (file name and line number) where the macro is invoked. Supports
 * printf-style formatting. NOTE: this macro is only active in debug build (if
 * NDEBUG is not defined).
 *
 * @param format  message format string. Should include the name of the function
 *                that incurred the error (either current function or a failed
 *                syscall or a library function) and (optionally) any additional
 *                information about the error.
 * @param ...     arguments for the format string, if any.
 *
 * Example:
 * 	int func(int arg)
 * 	{
 * 		if (arg_is_invalid) {
 * 			errno = EINVAL;
 * 			report_error("func: invalid arg = %d", arg);
 * 			return -1;
 * 		}
 *
 * 		...
 *
 * 		if (some_syscall(...) < 0) {
 * 			report_error("some_syscall");
 * 			return -1;
 * 		}
 *
 * 		...
 *
 * 	}
