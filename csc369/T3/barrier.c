/*
 * This program uses the barrier abstraction to synchronize a set of threads.
 * The threads all execute some number of "phases" and must wait for each other
 * at the barrier point at the end of each phase before they can proceed to the 
 * next phase. 
 *  
 * You will need to add the code to the barrier structure, as well as the 
 * barrier_init() and barrier() functions to ensure that all the prints from 
 * phase N appear before any of the prints from phase N+1.
 *  
 * There should be no enforced order on the prints from different threads in the
 * same phase. 
 *
 * For example, the following output for 4 threads and 2 phases are both allowed: 
 *
 * Legal output 1:                   Legal output 2:
 * thread 2 in phase 0.              thread 0 in phase 0.     
 * thread 1 in phase 0.		     thread 2 in phase 0.     
 * thread 0 in phase 0.		     thread 1 in phase 0.     
 * thread 3 in phase 0.		     thread 3 in phase 0.     
 * thread 2 in phase 1.		     thread 2 in phase 1.     
 * thread 1 in phase 1.		     thread 0 in phase 1.     
 * thread 0 in phase 1.		     thread 3 in phase 1.     
 * thread 3 in phase 1.		     thread 1 in phase 1.     
 * thread 1 done all phases.	     thread 2 done all phases.
 * thread 0 done all phases.	     thread 1 done all phases.
 * thread 3 done all phases.	     thread 0 done all phases.
 * thread 2 done all phases.	     thread 3 done all phases.
 * Barrier test complete.	     Barrier test complete.   
 *
 * All your changes should be made in this file.
 * You should not need to add any global variables, except by adding fields to 
 * struct barrier_s. 
 * You should not need to alter any functions except barrier_init() and 
 * barrier() to solve the problem.
