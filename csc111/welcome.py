"""CSC111 Winter 2023: Welcome File

Welcome to CSC111! This is a sample Python file that you should be able to
run after you have completed the steps in the Software Setup guide on our
First-Year Computer Science Summer Prep modules (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/160038/).

To run this file in PyCharm, go to Run -> Run... and select 'welcome' in the popup menu.
After you've run this program for the first time, you'll be able to re-run it
easily by pressing the green ▶ arrow in the toolbar on the top-right of your window.
