"""CSC111 Winter 2023 Prep 11: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This module contains the code for a set of classes used to represent expressions
that you would see in a Python program.

It includes the three classes Expr, Num, and BinOp covered in the prep readings.
Note that in addition to the initializer and evaluate methods, we've also
included a __str__ implementation for each class that shows the corresponding
Python expression that the tree represents.

Your task is to complete the implementations of three new classes:

1.  Bool: a constant boolean (similar to Num).
2.  BoolOp: a sequence of `and` or `or` expressions (similar to BinOp).
3.  Compare: a sequence of `<` and `<=` expressions (for simplicity, we'll
    ignore other forms of expressions like `>` and `==`).

Note that BoolOp and Compare are a bit more challenging than BinOp, because
both of them can have an *arbitrary number* of subtrees, rather than being
limited to exactly two subtrees. However, you can use the same recursive
"evaluate each subexpression recursively" idea as BinOp.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You may add additional doctests, but they will not be graded. You should test your work
carefully before submitting it!
