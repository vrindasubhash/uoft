Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This module contains the mergesort algorithm from the prep readings, as well as a few
additional functions for you to implement.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You may add additional doctests, but they will not be graded. You should test your work
carefully before submitting it!

    """Return a sorted list containing the items in lst.

    This function should use the same algorithm as the _merge helper function, with
    the two "sorted lists" being lst[:m] and lst[m:]. Follow the implementation of
    _merge as closely as possible, but you don't need to copy over the loop invariant.

    You may call len(lst) and use list indexing, but may not use any other list operations
    or methods (e.g., list.sort).

    Note that this function is public, as we are importing and testing it directly.

    Preconditions:
        - 0 <= m < len(lst)
        - is_sorted_sublist(lst, 0, m)
        - is_sorted_sublist(lst, m, len(lst))

    (You're welcome to copy over your implementation of is_sorted_sublist from last week's
    prep; if you don't, PythonTA will just ignore the last two preconditions.)

    This is similar to merge_indexed, except:
        - The two sublists are now lst[b:m] and lst[m:e]
        - Rather than returning a new list, this function mutates lst so that
          lst[b:e] is a sorted version of the two previous sublists.

    Preconditions:
        - 0 <= b <= m <= e <= len(lst)
        - is_sorted_sublist(lst, b, m)
        - is_sorted_sublist(lst, m, e)

    IMPORTANT implementation note: even though this function doesn't return a new list,
    you can still create a new local list object to do the merging, and then copy the
    contents back to lst[b:e] when you're done. This means that this algorithm won't be
    in-place (since it creates a list object of non-constant size), but that's okay.
    It's actually very complex to try to implement this function in an in-place way,
    just like it's hard to implement an in-place mergesort.

    As with merge_indexed, you should not use built-in sorting functions or other list
    methods, but instead follow the implementation of _merge as closely as possible.
    You may, but are not required to, assign to a list slice, e.g. lst[0:10] = ...
