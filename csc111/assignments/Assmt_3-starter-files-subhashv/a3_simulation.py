"""CSC111 Winter 2023 Assignment 3: Graphs and Interconnection Networks

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This module contains a collection of Python classes and functions that you'll use on
this assignment to run a network simulation. You are responsible for reading the
*docstrings* of this file to understand how to use these classes and functions, but should not
modify anything in this file (other than the optional part at the very end).

This file will not be submitted, and we will supply our own copy for testing purposes.

Note: as is standard for CSC111, we use a leading underscore to indicate private
functions, methods, and instance attributes. You don't have to worry about any of these,
and in fact shouldn't use them in this assignment!
