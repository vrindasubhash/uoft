"""CSC111 Winter 2023 Assignment 2: Trees, Wordle, and Artificial Intelligence

Module Description
==================

This module contains a collection of Python classes and functions that you'll use on
this assignment to represent games of Adversarial Wordle. You are responsible for reading the
*docstrings* of this file to understand how to use these classes and functions, but should not
modify anything in this file except:

1. Uncommenting the @check_contracts decorators (see note above the AdversarialWordle class).
2. Modifying the run_example function and main block.

This file will not be submitted, and we will supply our own copy for testing purposes.

Note: as is standard for CSC111, we use a leading underscore to indicate private
functions, methods, and instance attributes. You don't have to worry about any of these,
and in fact shouldn't use them in this assignment!

Disclaimer: we didn't have time to make this file fully PythonTA-compliant.

Copyright and Usage Information
===============================

This file is provided solely for the personal and private use of students
taking CSC111 at the University of Toronto St. George campus. All forms of
distribution of this code, whether as given or with any changes, are

# === NOTE ABOUT USING check_contracts (PLEASE READ!) ===
# Because this assignment involves longer computations, we recommend commenting out @check_contracts
# on the line below when running your code on the larger word sets. Doing so will speed up the running
# time of the AdversarialWordle methods. However, when first testing your code on smaller examples
# (which you should definitely do!), we recommend keeping @check_contracts uncommented to take
# advantage of the representation invariants and preconditions we've provided you. 😊
