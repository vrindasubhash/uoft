        The inserted moves form a chain of descendants, where:
            - moves[0] is a child of this tree's root
            - moves[1] is a child of moves[0]
            - moves[2] is a child of moves[1]
            - etc.

        Do not create duplicate moves that share the same parent; for example, if moves[0] is
        already a child of this tree's root, you should recurse into that existing subtree rather
        than create a new subtree with moves[0].
        But if moves[0] is not a child of this tree's root, create a new subtree for it
        and add it to the existing collection of subtrees.

        Preconditions:
        - moves alternates between str and tuple[str, ...] elements
        - if self.move == aw.GAME_START_MOVE or isinstance(self.move, tuple),

        - if self.move != aw.GAME_START_MOVE and isinstance(self.move, str),
         then moves == [] or isinstance(moves[0], tuple)

        Implementation Notes:
            - Your implementation must use recursion, and NOT use any loops to "go down" the tree.
                - "Using recursion" also includes calling a recursive helper method, like GameTree__str__.
            - Your implementation must have a worst-case running time of Theta(m) time, where m is
              the length of moves. This means you shouldn't use list slicing to access the "rest" of
              the list of moves, like in Tutorial 4. Instead, you can use one of the following approaches:

              i) Use a recursive helper method that takes an extra "current index" argument to
                 keep track of the next move in the list to add.
              ii) First reverse the list, and then use a recursive helper method that calls
                 `list.pop` on the list of moves. Just make sure the original list isn't changed
                 when the function ends!
