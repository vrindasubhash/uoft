def kropki_model(board):
    """
    Create a CSP for a Kropki Sudoku Puzzle given a board of dimension.

    If a variable has an initial value, its domain should only contain the initial value.
    Otherwise, the variable's domain should contain all possible values (1 to dimension).

    We will encode all the constraints as binary constraints.
    Each constraint is represented by a list of tuples, representing the values that
    satisfy this constraint. (This is the table representation taught in lecture.)

    Remember that a Kropki sudoku has the following constraints.
    - Row constraint: every two cells in a row must have different values.
    - Column constraint: every two cells in a column must have different values.
    - Cage constraint: every two cells in a 2x3 cage (for 6x6 puzzle) 
            or 3x3 cage (for 9x9 puzzle) must have different values.
    - Black dot constraints: one value is twice the other value.
    - White dot constraints: the two values are consecutive (differ by 1).

    Make sure that you return a 2D list of variables separately. 
    Once the CSP is solved, we will use this list of variables to populate the solved board.
    Take a look at csprun.py for the expected format of this 2D list.
