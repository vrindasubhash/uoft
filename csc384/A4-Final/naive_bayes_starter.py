    NaiveBayesModel returns a BN that is a Naive Bayes model that represents 
    the joint distribution of value assignments to variables in the given dataset.

    Remember a Naive Bayes model assumes P(X1, X2,.... XN, Class) can be represented as 
    P(X1|Class) * P(X2|Class) * .... * P(XN|Class) * P(Class).

    When you generated your Bayes Net, assume that the values in the SALARY column of 
    the dataset are the CLASS that we want to predict.

    Please name the factors as follows. If you don't follow these naming conventions, you will fail our tests.
    - The name of the Salary factor should be called "Salary" without the quotation marks.
    - The name of any other factor should be called "VariableName,Salary" without the quotation marks. 
      For example, the factor for Education should be called "Education,Salary".

    @return a BN that is a Naive Bayes model and which represents the given data set.
