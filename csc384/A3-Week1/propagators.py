    This is a propagator to perform forward checking. 

    First, collect all the relevant constraints.
    If the last assigned variable is None, then no variable has been assigned 
    and we are performing propagation before search starts.
    In this case, we will check all the constraints.
    Otherwise, we will only check constraints involving the last assigned variable.

    Among all the relevant constraints, focus on the constraints with one unassigned variable. 
    Consider every value in the unassigned variable's domain, if the value violates 
    any constraint, prune the value.

    :returns: The boolean indicates whether forward checking is successful.
        The boolean is False if at least one domain becomes empty after forward checking.

    Keep track of all the constraints in a queue (list). 
    If the last_assigned_var is not None, then we only need to 
    consider constraints that involve the last assigned variable.

    For each constraint, consider every variable in the constraint and 
    every value in the variable's domain.
    For each variable and value pair, prune it if it is not part of 
    a satisfying assignment for the constraint. 
    Finally, if we have pruned any value for a variable,
    add other constraints involving the variable back into the queue.
