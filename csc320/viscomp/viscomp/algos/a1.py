    # The idea is to loop through the 4 pairs of corresponding points between the source and destination images. 
    # For each pair of points, we will derive 2 equations: 
    #   - One equation for the x-coordinate in the destination image.
    #   - One equation for the y-coordinate in the destination image.
    #
    # Each pair of points generates these two equations, leading to a total of 8 equations. 
    # These 8 equations correspond to the 8 unknowns in the homography matrix (a, b, c, d, e, f, h, k), 
    # which map the source image coordinates to the destination image coordinates.
    #
    # Each equation is based on the coordinates of the source image (x_i, y_i) and involves the unknown homography matrix coefficients.
    # These equations are then set equal to their corresponding coordinates in the destination image (x'_i, y'_i).
    #
    # Once we have the system of 8 equations, we use NumPyâ€™s linear algebra solver to solve for the 8 unknown homography matrix values.
    # Then we will add 1 to the end of matrix and reshape to 3x3.
    # 
    # Once we have the matrix, we use NumPy's linear algebra solver to create the inverse of the matrix.   
    # Then we normalize it by the last value (2,2) and we have the inverse homography matrix.
