  ___Yes   _x_No

  If you checked yes, please supply the following

B. PLACE AN (X) IN FRONT OF PORTIONS OF THE ASSIGNMENT THAT YOU COMPLETED IN 
   FULL.
   
   If a portion of the assignment was not completed fully, please provide 
   additional information so that we can determine whether or not you are 
   eligible for partial credit. THE MORE INFORMATION YOU SUPPLY (EG. METHOD 
   WHICH CONTAINS PARTIAL CODE, SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN 
   YOUR PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION, DETAILED COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE, ETC) THE MORE 
   LIKELY IT IS WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT

_x_   ( 65 marks) Part 1.1    propagation_and_random_search() 
							  _x_ (50 marks) random search
							  _x_ (15 marks) propagation

_x_   ( 15 marks) Part 1.2	  reconstructed_source_from_target()

_x_   ( 10 marks) Part 1.3    efficiency

_x_   ( 10 marks) Part 2      PDF report & evaluation

Notes about assignment completion: I have attempted all the portions of this assignment. However, after testing it it doesn't seem to be working properly and I was not able to improve it after debugging. I have notes about where I think my errors are in my report. For the efficiency component, I didn't use loops in the reconstructed_source_from_target() and tried to minimize loops in the propagation_and_random_search(). I wanted to get propagation_and_random_search() working properly before trying to optimize it further, but as I was not able to get it properly implemented, I did not further try to optimize that function.
