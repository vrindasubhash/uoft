The most important data structure in the PatchMatch algorithm is the one
representing the nearest-neighbour field (NNF). As explained in Section 3 of
the paper, this is a vector field f over the image, ie. a mapping from pixel
coordinates (x,y) to 2D displacements f(x,y). In this module we will represent
a displacement field as a numpy matrix. Given a NxM openCV source image,
the nearest-neighbour field is a matrix of size NxMx2.

    the pixel's coordinates. In this way, the generated random numbers are
    turned into 2D displacements.
